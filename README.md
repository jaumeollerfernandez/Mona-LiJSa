## Objective
Project made in class to practise usage of Canvas. I saw some people drawing with pure css images, and i thought it would be fun to replicate it with Javascript and with "one by one" drawing.

## Can you use it?

Yes, it's just for practise and understanding initial concepts of Canvas. Feel free to use it. It would be great if you reference me. Since it's free, i would appreciate it.
